    abstract = "{Length‐biased sampling occurs in renewal processes when the probability that an interval is selected is proportional to the length of the interval. This can occur when intervals are selected because they contain an event that is independent of the renewal process and occurs with constant hazard. For example, if the times between donations for repeat blood donors are independent and identically distributed, and if the donor seroconverts to HIV (develops antibodies that indicate infection with human immunodeficiency virus), then the interval between the last HIV seronegative and first HIV seropositive test is expected to be longer than that donor's previous time intervals between donations. We develop hypothesis tests to determine if the relationship between the typical and length‐biased intervals is as expected, or if there is departure from length‐biased sampling. We further develop a regression method to determine if there are covariates that explain the departure from length‐biased sampling. Our approach is motivated by the question of whether there is evidence that repeat blood donors who develop antibodies to HIV or other viral infections change their donation pattern in some way because of seroconversion.}",
