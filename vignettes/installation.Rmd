# 1. Introduction

Package **`r pkgName`** is written in programming language R and end user must have access to a 
working installation of R engine. This document describes the most common setup with R installed 
locally on the user's computer. The screenshots refer to the classical R interface, but the package 
can also be opened in other Graphical User Interfaces for R like e.g. 
[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

# 2. Installation steps

R is a free software program and can be downloaded from [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/).
After downloading the appropriate version for your computer's operating system, install R on your computer following the standard procedure 
applicable to the operating system. For Windows the file to be downloaded is the so-called *base* 
distribution: [http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).

## 2.1. Installing R

Start the R installer and follow the presented steps:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.pos="!h", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("fig/setup1.png")
```

It is advised to have R installed in folder that does not contain spaces, therefore please adjust 
the destination location accordingly:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.pos="!h", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("fig/setup2.png")
```

The **serocalculator** package is compatible with both the 32-bit and the 64-bit version of R. 
Choose the preferred platform (or both). If unsure install the 32-bit version only, however
on compatible platforms the 64-bit version may provide better performance:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.pos="!h", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("fig/setup3.png")
```

It is advised to select *Registry entries* in the next step for best experience:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.pos="!h", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("fig/setup4.png")
```

R interpreter, when installed on Windows, can be invoked from the start menu folder named **R**.

Start the preferred version of R (if both the 32-bit: *R i386* and the 64-bit: *x64* are installed).
Graphical user interface for R interpreter will start in a new window:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.pos="!h", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("fig/RGui1.png")
```

## 2.2. Installing *serocalculator* package

Since this is a new installation of R, the **serocalculator** package must be installed before first use. As of 09/20/2023, **serocalculator** is still in development. To install the development version, you must install the **devtools** package and then download **serocalculator** from GitHub. 

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ucd-serg/serocalculator")
```

# 3. Post-installation

Successful installation can be confirmed by loading the package into the workspace 
and exploring help files and manuals distributed with the package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load package "seroincidence".
library(serocalculator)

# Show R help for the package.
?serocalculator

# Show tutorial for the package.
vignette(topic = "tutorial", package = "serocalculator")
```

Additionally, most package details can be found when executing the following commands:
```{r}
# Show description.
packageDescription("serocalculator")

# Show citation.
citation("serocalculator")
```
