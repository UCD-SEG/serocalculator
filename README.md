seroincidence package
=====================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Antibody levels measured in a (cross--sectional) population sample can be translated into an estimate of the frequency with which seroconversions (infections) occur in the sampled population. Formulated simply: the presence of many high titres indicates that many subjects likely experienced infection recently, while low titres indicate a low frequency of infections in the sampled population.

The seroincidence calculator script was designed to use the longitudinal response characteristics by means of a set of parameters characterizing the longitudinal response of the selected serum antibodies. These parameters are peak concentrations and decay rates (describing the maximum antibody concentration reached after seroconversion and the rate with which the antibody concentration decreases, assuming first order, or exponential, kinetics).
