Antibody levels measured in a cross–sectional population sample can be translated into an estimate of the frequency with which seroconversions (infections) occur in the sampled population. In other words, the presence of many high antibody titers indicates that many individuals likely experienced infection recently and the burden of disease is high in the population, while low titers indicate a low frequency of infections in the sampled population and therefore a lower burden of disease.

The **serocalculator** package was designed to use the longitudinal response characteristics using a set of modeled parameters characterizing the longitudinal response of the selected serum antibodies. 

## Methods

The **serocalculator** R package provides a rapid and computationally simple method for calculating seroconversion rates, as originally published in @Simonsen_2009 and @Teunis_2012, and further developed in subsequent publications by @de_Graaf_2014, @Teunis_2016, and @Teunis_2020. In short, longitudinal seroresponses from confirmed cases with a known symptom onset date are assumed to represent the time course of human serum antibodies against a specific pathogen. Therefore, by using these longitudinal antibody dynamics with any cross–sectional sample of the same antibodies in a human population, an incidence estimate can be calculated. Further details are below.

### A Proxy for Infection 
 
While the exact time of infection is impossible to measure in an individual, antibody levels measured in a cross–sectional population sample can be translated into an estimate of the frequency with which seroconversions (infections) occur in the sampled population. So the presence of many high antibody concentrations indicates that many people in the population likely experienced infection recently, while mostly low concentrations indicate a low frequency of infections in the sampled population.


In order to interpret the measured cross-sectional antibody concentrations in terms of incidence, we must define the antibody dynamic over time to understand the generalized antibody response at different times since infection. This dynamic must be quantified over time to include an initial increase in serum antibody concentration when seroconversion occurs, followed by a gradual decrease as antibodies wane. In published studies, this information on the time course of the serum antibody response has been obtained from longitudinal follow–up data in cases who had a symptomatic episode following infection. In this case, the onset of symptoms then provides a proxy for the time that infection occurred. 

### The Seroincidence Estimator

The **serocalculator** package was designed to calculate the incidence of seroconversion by using the longitudinal seroresponse characteristics. The distribution of serum antibody concentrations in a cross–sectional population sample is calculated as a function of the longitudinal seroresponse and the frequency of seroconversion (or seroincidence). Given the seroresponse, this marginal distribution of antibody concentrations can be fitted to the cross-sectional data and thereby providing a means to estimate the seroincidence.

## Installing R

The **serocalculator** package is written in R, a free, open-source software program. The end user of this package must have access to a working installation of the R software. We recommend installing [base R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and a Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for R such as [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

If you need to download and install R and/or RStudio, we recommend following the tutorial below from *Hands On Programming in R* by Garrett Grolemund:

**Installing R and RStudio**: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html

## Installing the Serocalculator Package

The **serocalculator** package must be installed in R before first use. As of November 21, 2023, **serocalculator** is still in development. To install the development version, you must install the **devtools** R package and then download **serocalculator** from [GitHub](https://github.com/). Enter the code below into the R console to install both packages:


```r{eval=FALSE}
# Install the devtools package and the development version of serocalculator
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ucd-serg/serocalculator")

```

### Post-installation

Successful installation can be confirmed by loading the package into the RStudio workspaceand exploring help files and manuals distributed with the package:

```r{eval=FALSE}
# Load package "seroincidence".
library(serocalculator)

# Show R help for the package.
?serocalculator
```

Additionally, most package details can be found when executing the following commands:

```r{eval=FALSE}
# Show description.
packageDescription("serocalculator")

# Show citation.
citation("serocalculator")
```

### A Note for Windows Users

Windows users will need to install Rtools, which contains a collection of tools for building and employing R packages that are still in development. This can be done either during the  *devtools* package installation, or independently if *devtools* is already installed. 


#### During devtools installation:

When prompted to install additional build tools, select "Yes" and Rtools will be installed. 

![Click Yes to install Rtools along with the *devtools* package][id]

[id]: man/figures/Rtools1.png

#### Independently:

1. Download Rtools from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
2. Run the installer

    * During the Rtools installation you may see a window asking you to “Select Additional Tasks”.
    * Do **not** select the box for “Edit the system PATH”. devtools and RStudio should put Rtools on the PATH automatically when it is needed.
    * **Do** select the box for “Save version information to registry”. It should be selected by default.

## Getting Help

If you need assistance or encounter a clear bug, please file an issue with a minimal reproducible example on [GitHub](https://github.com/UCD-SERG/serocalculator/issues). 

Another great resource is **The Epidemiologist R Handbook**, which includes an introductory page on asking for help with R packages via GitHub: https://epirhandbook.com/en/getting-help.html
